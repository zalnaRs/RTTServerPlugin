# RTTServerPlugin

This is a [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) plugin for my Minecraft server.

You can join the server when I stream on TikTok or YouTube.

Server's website: [https://randomttips.netlify.app/server](https://randomttips.netlify.app/server)

## Usage

If you want to use this plugin for your own server do this:

- Compile with Java 21
- Run the server with `--enable-preview` argument as it uses string templates.
